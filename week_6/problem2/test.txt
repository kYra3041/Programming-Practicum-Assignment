2. Write a program with recurrence function to calculate x! (x factorial)!

Input: 5
Expected Output: 5! = 120
Explanation: The factorial of 5 is calculated as 5×4×3×2×1=120.

Input: 0
Expected Output: 0! = 1
Explanation: By definition, the factorial of 0 is 1.

Input: 1
Expected Output: 1! = 1
Explanation: The factorial of 1 is 1 by definition.

Input: 10
Expected Output: 10! = 3628800
Explanation: The factorial of 10 is calculated as 10×9×8×...×1=3628800.

Input: -3
Expected Output: Factorial cannot be calculated for negative numbers!
Explanation: The input is negative, so the program should output an error message.
