3. Write a program with recurrence function to calculate GCD (Greater Common
Division)!

Test Case 1: Valid Input with Common Factor
Input: num1 = 48, num2 = 18
Expected Output: GCD = 6

Test Case 2: Valid Input with Large Numbers
Input: num1 = 270, num2 = 192
Expected Output: GCD = 6

Test Case 3: Valid Input with Prime Numbers
Input: num1 = 17, num2 = 13
Expected Output: GCD = 1

Test Case 4: Valid Input with One Number as 1
Input: num1 = 1, num2 = 25
Expected Output: GCD = 1

Test Case 5: Invalid Input (Negative Number)
Input: num1 = -5, num2 = 15
Expected Output: "please enter positive integers only :D"
