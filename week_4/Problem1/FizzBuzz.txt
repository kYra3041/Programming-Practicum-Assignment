The FizzBuzz problem is defined as follows: Write a C++ program that prints the
numbers from 1 to 100. However, for multiples of three, print ”Fizz” instead of the
number, and for multiples of five, print ”Buzz”. For numbers that are multiples of both
three and five, print ”FizzBuzz”. You must store the result of this computation in a
std::vector before printing the output.
